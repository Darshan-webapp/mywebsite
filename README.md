# mywebsite
## Portfolio website
### To Host or deploying the HTML static website using GitHub pages first I have created one repository on my GitHub.
### Then I cloned it into my local and pushed the main website's sourcecode.
### After that go to GitHub pages which is in setting option under build and deployment option we have to select the branch and folder.
### and after saving that we can see the deployment of the website started doing process.
### and after few minutes when it complete the deploying process a website url can be seen inside Github Pages setting.
### Below i have attached some screenshots of my work.
